This is a hack/POC to show updater from android recovery building on GNU/Linux.
This is not meant to be used and I am aware the build script is disgusting :)

Below is a rough set of dependencies that you'll need (note that you need the
-dev/-devel libs for these)

Dependencies:
openssl, libz, libz2, keystore, gtest, libcap, libzip

Build utils:
autotools, cmake, g++ (with c++17 support), yacc, flex
